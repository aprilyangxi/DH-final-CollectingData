# DH-final-CollectingData
this is re-writen version of assignment 4

I have asked two questions in this assignment. One is the issue of gender and the other is the place of birth of each author.
It is clear from the gender distribution that male artists make up the majority, accounting for 96% of all artists. 
This suggests that there weren't many educated women around at the time.
Men and women were disproportionately underrepresented in the allocation of educational resources. 
Given the geographical distribution of the artists, we can see that 94.9% of them were born in London, 
which indicates that the city was at the time the undisputed cultural hub of Great Britain.
This demonstrates that at the time, London was the country's cultural epicenter. 
Additionally, it conveys the political and financial success of London at the period.

but i don't know why charts cannot be seen in github file
so i add them additionally
